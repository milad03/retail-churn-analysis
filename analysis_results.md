# Analysis & Strategic Recommendations

## 1. Executive Summary
The analysis processed $8.91M in revenue across 18.54K orders. The data reveals a business heavily dependent on the UK market with a significant customer retention challenge.

## 2. Key Findings

### Churn Risk is Critical
* **Finding:** 66.61% of the customer base (2.89K customers) are classified as "High Risk," meaning they have not made a purchase in the last 90 days.
* **Impact:** The majority of the customer base consists of one-time buyers who do not return.

### Market Concentration
* **Finding:** The United Kingdom is the dominant revenue driver, generating over $7M.
* **Contrast:** International markets (Netherlands, EIRE, Germany) show potential but represent a small fraction of total sales.

### Seasonal Volatility
* **Finding:** Revenue shows a massive upward trend beginning in September 2011, peaking in November/December.
* **Insight:** The business is highly seasonal, likely driven by holiday gifting.

## 3. Recommendations
1.  **Launch a Win-Back Campaign:** Target the "High Risk" segment with email marketing incentives (e.g., "We miss you" coupons) to reduce the 66% churn rate.
2.  **Optimize Inventory for Q4:** Based on the November peak, inventory stocking should begin in August to prevent stockouts during the holiday rush.
3.  **Expand International Marketing:** The Netherlands and EIRE show organic traction; a localized marketing test in these regions could diversify revenue away from solely the UK.
